# A *Faster* Pytorch Implementation of Faster R-CNN with Pruning

## Introduction

This is a fork of the original jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch Faster R-CNN code. This project add additional pruning to the Faster R-CNN like architecture in order to make it smaller and faster.

Currently there's 3 pruning techniques implemented:
- L1 Pruning (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJqFGTslg)
- Entropy Pruning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05791)
- Molchanov (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06440)
